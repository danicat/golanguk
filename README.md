# Go in the UK (except crypto!)

This repo contains a list of companies currently using #golang in the UK. It excludes crypto companies because of reasons.

Ok, what reasons you ask? First, I don't support crypto for environmental and social impacts, I think it's one of the most harmful technologies we have ever invented. I'm yet to see a good use that is not just waste of energy to enable people to gamble (and potentially lose all their life savings).

Secondly, all the good Go developer positions get lost in the noise of crypto recruiting. So this repo aims to amplify those companies and positions to make them easier to find for people who also don't want to work with crypto.
